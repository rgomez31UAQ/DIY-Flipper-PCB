# Flipper DIY
**Designed by enexis & dripside**

![pcb img](images/PCB_Photo.png)

This project is an open-source, DIY-friendly replacement PCB for the Flipper Zero. It is designed to be **fully compatible** with the original Flipper Zero housing without any modifications to the plastic shell. Whether you are building from scratch or repairing a device, this board brings the full suite of Flipper capabilities to a custom PCB.

**Firmware Compatibility:**
The PCB trace routing and pinout are fully compatible with the firmware configuration used in the [GthiN89/FuckingCheapFlipperZero](https://github.com/GthiN89/FuckingCheapFlipperZero-DIY-Flipper-zero-The-real-on) project. This ensures that you can use the software and pin definitions from that repository without additional mapping.
## Features & Support

* **Sub-GHz:** Full radio support via external module.
* **NFC:** High-performance NFC read/write capabilities.
* **Infrared (IR):** Dedicated Send and Receive channels.
* **External GPIO:** Standard 0.1" headers for modules and debugging.
* **iButton:** 1-Wire protocol support for Dallas keys.
* **Peripheral Support:** Full support for original buttons and the LCD.
* **Form Factor:** 100% mechanical compatibility with the original case.

## Assembly Instructions

To ensure a successful build, follow this specific soldering order to avoid mechanical interference:

1. **Phase 1 (Low Profile):** Solder the **MicroSD slot**, the **Shift Register (SN74HC165D)**, and all **SMD Resistors**. These are difficult to access once larger components are installed.
2. **Phase 2 (Display):** Install the **LCD screen**. Make sure it is perfectly aligned before soldering the ribbon cable/pins. After soldering, trim off any protruding pins at the back so they don't interfere with subsequent installation of **external GPIOs**.
3. **Phase 3 (GPIOs):** Solder the **External GPIOs** and trim the protruding pins so that they do not interfere with the installation of the CC1101
4. **Phase 4 (Final):** Solder all remaining components, including the MCU, NFC module, and buttons.

### Antenna Installation

The Sub-GHz antenna requires a two-step connection:

* First, solder the antenna wire to its **dedicated pin** on the PCB.
* Then, bridge/solder the connection to the **CC1101 (AS07-M1101S)** module output.
